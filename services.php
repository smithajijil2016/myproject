									<h3><span>Travel</span> Resources</h3>
									
									<p>The growing cost of travel, currency fluctuation and emphasis on corporate cost reduction put significant pressure on those responsible for corporate travel management and procurement within any organization. Consolidating travel programs for companies with multiple office locations with a single travel management company can dramatically enhance a company’s overall travel program, delivering better service with improved management policies and ROI.

									  <h3><span>Access</span> Guides</h3>
									  
									 		<p>here are a lot of views whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Different people has different viewpoint. In my opinion, a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. The argument for this view goes as follows:

In the first place, there are many advantages when people travel in a group. First, people will not feel boring in a long trip. People can talk, laugh and make joking like a big family. Second, the group will help you a lot when you have any emergency. </p>

									<h3><span>Airline</span> Travels</h3>
									
									   <p>Air travel is a form of travel in vehicles such as ,helicopters, hot air balloons, blimps, gliders, hang gliding, parachuting, airplanes or anything else that can sustain flight.Use of air travel has greatly increased in recent decades.Air travel can be separated into two general classifications: national/domestic and international flights. Flights from one point to another within the same country are called domestic flights. Flights from a point in one country to a point within a different country are known as international flights. </p>

									  <h3><span>Travel </span>Companions</h3>
									    <p>It’s really a good experience to know a new people from different cultures and languages. But there is an argument about preferring to travel alone or with companions. Some people enjoy traveling alone, some will choose traveling with  friends for many different reasons.Traveling with companions can provide for all a good helping and the trip will be safer. Sometime unexpected troubles can happen and when you are alone on the city rather than yours, that will be a serious problem because you don’t know what you have to do</p>

							<p> <strong> Some places it is so exciting to observe city views and imagine how thousands of people live in there and experience so many different feelings. The views of nature are also exciting, as while watching them, I wonder how such beauty can be created and how it is important not to spoil it.</p>

						<h3>TESTIMONIALS :</h3>
						<p>Work in the travel and tourism industry is essentially concerned with providing services for people who are away from home, on business or holiday. Travel can be leisure travel involving package tours, pilgrim travel, adventure travel etc or purely business. Work at every functional level in the industry involves dealing directly with people. Travel agents assess the needs of tourists and businessmen and help them make the best possible travel arrangements from the many travel options available. Also, many major cruise lines, resorts, and specialty travel groups use travel agents to promote travel packages to the millions of people who travel every year. </p>
